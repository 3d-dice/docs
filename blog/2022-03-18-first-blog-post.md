It's been almost 2 years since I started digging into what it would take to build a fantastic dice roller that *anyone* could use in their own JavaScript projects. I've spend many hours optimizing this project so it would be both flexible and performant. I'm hopeful that it will gain traction and live up to expectations.

I have some more exciting features in que before hitting the version 1.0 switch. I'm also waiting on [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) to hit [version 5](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/babylon-js-5-is-coming/26750) this Spring.

This site will continue to be updated along the way.

Cheers!
