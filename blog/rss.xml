I've spend many hours optimizing this project so it would be both flexible and performant. I'm hopeful that it will gain traction and live up to expectations.</p><p>I have some more exciting features in que before hitting the version 1.0 switch. I'm also waiting on <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BabylonJS</a> to hit <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/babylon-js-5-is-coming/26750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 5</a> this Spring.</p><p>This site will continue to be updated along the way.</p><p>Cheers!</p>]]></content:encoded>
