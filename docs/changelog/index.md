# Release Notes

When I started this project I wasn't sure how or when I was going to release it publically. It was mostly a push to get features working. However, now that it's almost ready to go to version 1.0 I see the need to capture more project documentation and changelogs. I will try to backfill older changelogs when I have time.

 * [Version 0.6](/releaseNotes/version-0.6)
 * [Version 0.5](/releaseNotes/version-0.5)
 * [Version 0.4](/releaseNotes/version-0.4)
