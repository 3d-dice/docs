# Genesys
The first theme made available that uses symbols instead of numbers. This theme posed many challenges for implementation but is finally ready for release with `v1.1.0`. This theme uses the `genesys` mesh. A special thanks to [Arran France](https://arranfrance.com/) and the team at [Quest Portal](https://www.questportal.com/) for providing the original dice set.

## Addons
Since Genesys dice are so unique, additional addons where made to ensure it could interface with Dice Box correctly and adequately.
