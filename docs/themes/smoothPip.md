Extends the [Smooth](/docs/themes/smooth) theme by adding a six sided dice with pips instead of numbers.

:::info Dice Available
`dpip`
:::

## Caveat
The die type `dpip` is not recognized by the [Advanced Dice Roller](/docs/addons/advRoller). So, unfortunately, it is incompatible with that addon.

## Install
```javascript
npm install @3d-dice/theme-smooth-pip
```
