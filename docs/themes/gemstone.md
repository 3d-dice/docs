# Gemstone
This theme is an attempt to create some uniquely shaped dice that are quite different from the standard set. This theme uses the `gemstone` mesh.

`d4` `d6` `d8` `d10` `d12` `d20` `d100`

## Configurable Colors
Use the `themeColor` config option to change the color of the dice. Based on the color's luminosity, the numbers will automatically switch between black and white for improved contrast.
