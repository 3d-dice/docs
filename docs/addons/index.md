# Addons
In this project I refer to addons as JavaScript modules that can be used with Dice-Box. So far I've created four modules that are designed to integrate with Dice-Box. More are planned and I certainly encourage others to build their own.

1. [Fantastic Dice Parser](/docs/addons/parser)
2. [Advanced Dice Roller](/docs/addons/advInput)
3. [Display Results](/docs/addons/displayResults)
4. [DAT GUI module](/docs/addons/datgui)
