# About Addons
In this project I refer to addons as JavaScript modules that can be used with Dice-Box. So far I've created four modules that are designed to integrate with Dice-Box. More are planned and I certainly encourage others to build their own.

1. [Dice Parser Interface](/docs/addons/parser)
1. [Advanced Dice Roller](/docs/addons/advRoller)
1. [Dice Picker](/docs/addons/dicePicker)
1. [Display Results](/docs/addons/displayResults)
1. [Box Controls](/docs/addons/boxControls)
1. [Genesys Dice Picker](/docs/addons/genesysDicePicker)
